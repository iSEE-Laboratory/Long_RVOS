Hi, guys. Our datasets and code will be released in the coming days. We hope this won’t impact your progress for CVPR.😥

We’re currently exploring platforms for hosting our test set evaluation. Given the large number of frames in our test set, we need a platform that supports multithreaded evaluation to ensure efficient processing.

Please let us know if you have any good suggestions~
